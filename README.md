# README

This is potentiometer(MCP4241-104) control from Microchip PIC16F677.


## Practice
Microchip output order to potentiometer by changing input port RA0.


## Usage

1. Communicate with SPI MODE between two micoms.

2. Microchip control potentiometer between R1A abd R1W.
   Registance value between R1A abd R1W is 97kƒ¶ and 98ƒ¶ by changing input port RA0.

3. Registance value between R1A abd R1W is low from spec unless R1B doesn't connect ground.
